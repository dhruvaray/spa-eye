                <h4>Application layer debugging</h4>

                <p>Understand Backbone application behavior without wading through JavaScript code. Backbone Eye is
                    production-site friendly and can work off uglified and minified Javascript without needing any
                    source maps.</p><br/>

                <h4>Work with application constructs</h4>

                <p>Backbone Eye presents application specific models and views to introspect. Models show only
                    application specific properties and shield away internal Backbone framework details. Search for
                    models having certain attribute values, pin interesting models or use most-used models list to dig
                    deeper.</p>

                <h4>Encourages <a href="#what-if">"What-if"</a> exploration</h4>

                <p>Change an application model attribute and see the impact of the change throughout the application in
                    a graphical fashion. Or drill down to details about past state and operation arguments.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="col-sm-6">

                <h4>Detect Zombies</h4>

                <p>Backbone Eye attempts to detect models and views which are used by the application - even after they
                    have been destroyed. Leverage the model interaction trails and journals to piece together what may
                    have triggered this behavior.</p><br/>

                <h4>Understand event-callback entropy</h4>

                <p>Visualize how Backbone Model (and Collection) updates may lead to redundant calls (multiple render
                    calls to the same view as a result of an update). Develop insights into application flow to minimize
                    (or remove) redundant callbacks and thereby improve application performance.</p>

                <h4>Debug templates</h4>

                <p>Backbone Eye makes underscore templates a debuggable unit. Put breakpoints in template code. At
                    runtime, inspect model data being passed to the template, step through template code and
                    observe template output being incrementally built.</p><br/><br/>

            <br/><h4>Enumeration of Model attributes</h4><br/>
            Backbone Eye only enumerates application specific model properties and hides internal Backbone properties.
            Internal properties can be viewed - if required - in the journal and interaction trails views. <br/><img
                src="./site/img/modelattributes.png" alt="Shows only model attributes"/><br/>

            <br id="what-if"/>
            <br/><br/><h4>Edit model attributes</h4><br/>

            Backbone Eye allows you to edit the value of a model attribute to see the ripple effect - that model change
            - has on the entire application. To edit any attribute value, double click on the attribute name of the
            specific model and change it to a new value.<br/>

            <br/><span class="label label-info">Internals</span> This maps to model.set({attribute_name:value})<br/>
            <br/><span class="label label-success">Simulate "what-if" scenarios</span> In the todo example, it is
            possible to change the model value from the UI as well (Primarily because it is editable, visible on the
            screen etc). But in the general case, it may be difficult to use application screens to edit model values.
            This feature will help you simulate what-if scenarios by allowing to update model attributes directly. To
            see the impact of the update, use the model <a href="#trails">interaction trails</a>.<br/></span><br/>

            This section shows a sequence of interactions which have occurred on the selected model as a result of
            standard Backbone write operations - save, fetch, set, destroy, reset and sort among others. The trails has
            a graphical section which shows overall flow characteristics at a glance. The tabular section - on the other
            hand - shows the state of the model at various time points of the flow (as well as parameters which were
            passed in at that time point). This would be useful to work backwords to infer observed application
            behavior.<br/>

            <br/><img src="./site/img/interaction_plot_table.png" alt="Model interaction trail"/><br/>

            <br/>The view shows the interactions which have happened at time t = 0, 1, 2 ... n. To view a interaction at
            t = m, click on the t = m header. The interaction trail is updated to show the flow at t=m. Expand the t=m
            section to
            see detailed info about the state of various participating entities, message name and parameters. By
            default, the last interaction is shown when you navigate to the interaction trails view.

            <h4>Template inference</h4><br/>
            Backbone Eye <b>infers</b> templates which may have been used to render the views. In case a template-id was
            not specified in the application, a dummy template-id is assigned (starting with template_). This becomes
            the surrogate key of the template. These templates are visible in Firebug's Script Panel.<br/>
            <br/><img src="./site/img/view_templatelisting.png"
                      alt="View Templates shown in the source box of Firebug script panel"/><br/>

            <br/><h4>Debug the view generation process</h4><br/>
            View template can now be debugged - just like regular JavaScript code. The list of templates discovered by
            Backbone Eye are now present in the Script panel of Firebug.<br/><br/><img
                src="./site/img/view_templatelisting.png"
                alt="View Templates shown in the source box of Firebug script panel"/><br/><br/>The
            Javascript code to transform the the template (with data values) is shown in the source box. The source is
            commented with the
            template tags so it is easy to see what JavaScript maps to that template snippet. The Script panel has a new
            side-panel : <b>Views</b>. When a view template is being debugged, this panel becomes active and shows the
            data
            being passed to the template, the source template and the incremental template string being populated with
            data as the debugger steps through the template generation process.<br/><br/><img

            <br/><h4>Identify a View</h4><br/>
            It may be necessary to identify a Backbone View from an application screen. Conversely, it may be
            interesting to know what application screen a Backbone view corresponds to. Backbone Eye allows for both
            kinds of discovery.
            <br/><br/>
            Click on a view in Backbone Eye to see the corresponding screen highlighted in the application.

            Using the Firebug inspector to select a screen in the application. The corresponding Backbone view in
            Backbone
            Eye will be highlighted and expanded.<br/><br/><img src="./site/img/view_iclick.png"
